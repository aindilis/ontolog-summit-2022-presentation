And here are some recent very bad musings on trying to
use (abductive) practical reasoning to "prove" that in lieu of a
better approach to increasing proof-theoretic strength one
should package software.

task(A,'Increase Proof-theoretic strength').

task(B,'Increase Kolmogorov complexity.').

always(eventually(A)) -> always(eventually(B)).

task(C,'Increase program size.').

always(eventually(B)) -> always(eventually(C)).

task(D,'Gather more software.').

always(D) -> always(eventually(B)).

# Abductive practical reasoning allows affirming the consequent in
# the absense of competing strategies, as an educated guess, i.e.:

always(eventually(B)) -> always(D).

# Therefore:

always(eventually(A)) -> always(D).

# i.e.

always(eventually('Increase Proof-theoretic strength')) -> always('Gather more software').

always(A) -> always(eventually(A)).

# Therefore.

always('Increase Proof-theoretic strength') -> always('Gather more software').

# ^^^ Seems suspect, probably due to abductive inference not carrying or something.
